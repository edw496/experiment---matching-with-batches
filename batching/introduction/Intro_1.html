    Thank you for participating in this study.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this task you will submit a preference list of university courses. For the purpose of this task, you are given a numerical score of 80.00 to be used to apply for university courses for the year of 2024.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each university course will display the minimum score that was required to be made an offer in the previous year of 2023. This is called the Lowest Selection Score (LSS) from 2023. These can be used as a guide for the courseâ€™s LSS for 2024. You will be made an offer to a course if your score is higher than the LSS for 2024, which is not known to you currently.
