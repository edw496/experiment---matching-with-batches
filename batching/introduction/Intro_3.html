        Consider the LSS’s from 2023 as approximate cut-off points for being made an offer to certain courses. Again, this is based on the LSS’s in 2024, which are currently unknown to you. The LSS may change from 2023 to 2024, but you do not know by how much.
    </p>
    <p>
        The further below that your score of 80.00 is from the 2023 LSS, the lesser the chance of being made an offer. Conversely, the further above that your score is from the 2023 LSS, the greater the chance of being made an offer.

    <p>
        Lastly, there is also one course with guaranteed entry that has certainty of being you being made an offer. You can think of this as meaning that the 2024 LSS for the guaranteed entry course is known and public. Entry is guaranteed since your score of 80.00 is higher than that.
