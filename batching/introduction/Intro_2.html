        Based on your preferences, a process will determine whether you are made an offer to a course. This process takes the first-preferred course on your preference list and:
    </p>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li> if you are made an offer to your first-preferred course, you will then be paid the associated monetary payoff. </li>
        <li> if you are not made an offer, you are then considered for your second-preferred course. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This process continues until all five preferences have been exhausted. If you are made an offer to a university course, you will be paid the associated monetary amount as a bonus payment in addition to your participation fee of £1.50. All payments will be processed via Prolific at the conclusion of the study.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each course will be identifiable by a numerical code, the LSS from 2023 and the associated monetary payoff of being made an offer into that particular course.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the higher the LSS from 2023, the higher the monetary payoff. Remember that you do not know the courses’ LSS for 2024, so you should use the LSS from 2023 as a guide.
