    <h4>Criteria for university course acceptance</h4>
    <p>
        Consider the LSR’s from 2023 as approximate cut-off points for acceptance into certain courses. Again, acceptance is based on the LSR’s in 2024, which are currently unknown to you. The LSR may change from 2023 to 2024, but you do not know by how much.
    </p>
    <p>
        The further below that your ATAR is from the 2023 LSR, the lesser the chance of being accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conversely, the further above that your ATAR is from the 2023 LSR, the greater the chance of being accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, there is also one course with guaranteed entry, Course 24, which has certainty of being you being accepted. You can think of this as meaning that this year’s LSR will not change from the previous year’s LSR.
